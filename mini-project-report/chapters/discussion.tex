Testing the SafeScript vulnerability detection system has shown that it operates effectively and efficiently. However, there are several areas for 
future work to enhance the system further. These areas include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Comprehensive repository scanning
\item Improved reporting mechanisms
\item Automated web-based testing for vulnerabilities
\item Direct code fixes for detected vulnerabilities
\item Integration of more advanced and effective models
\item Using taketoken library for counting users usage and pricing
\end{itemize}

In conclusion, the current features of the system work flawlessly, enabling SafeScript to accurately scan and detect vulnerabilities using both models.
