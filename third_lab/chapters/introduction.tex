\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:introduction}

This lab focused on demonstrating a previously trained Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and implementing alternative machine learning models for vulnerability detection in software projects.

\section{Phase 1: LSTM Model Demonstration}
In the first phase, we revisited the LSTM model, observed its performance on test data, and analyzed its strengths and weaknesses.

\section{Phase 2: Implementation of Alternative Models}
In the second phase, we implemented Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models for vulnerability detection.

\section{Objectives}
The primary objectives were to demonstrate the LSTM model's effectiveness, evaluate alternative models, and compare their performance for vulnerability detection.
